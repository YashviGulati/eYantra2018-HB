eYRC HB#5374
We have updated the data_via_rosservice file to make a publisher which send the yaw value of the drone for the Yaw tuning
Hence, we have attached the data_via_rosservice file of the plutoserver package. (It can alternatively be used as a node in the launch file)

We have added the keys for use to set the tree positions and disarming the drone via our python code using key '7' (alternative to key 'd')
Hence, we have attached the key_command.py script of the plutoserver package.

Compiled launch file is also attached
